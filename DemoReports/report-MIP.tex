\paragraph{Task~a: Model.}
We define the variables first:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $z$ be the number of zones.
  \item Let $s$ be the number of service stations.
  \item Let $v$ be the number of vehicle, we will therefore have $v \cdot s$ of vehicles at our disposal in total.
  \item Let $c$ be the number of vehicles considered
  \item Let $d$ be a tuple of length $z$ giving the demand for each zone $z$.
  \item Let $T$ be a matrix of dimension $z \times z$ with the travel time from one zone to the other.
\end{itemize}
The problem we want to optimise is to select $s$ zones in which we will place our service stations. Our objective is to minimise the sum over the average travel time of the $c$ closest vehicles of each zone multiplied by the demand of the zone. Mathematically, this leads to the following function:


\begin{align*}
  M & = \sum_{k=1}^{z} \frac{1}{c}\left(\sum_{\ell = 1}^{c}  T_{v(\ell) k} \right) \cdot d_k
\end{align*}

Where we choose the $T_{v(\ell) k}$ in such a way, that the value of $M$ is minimal, where the $v(\ell)$ indicates the zone of the vehicle. As we have to choose 


\paragraph{Task~b: Implementation.}
Our model \texttt{servStatLoc.mod} is \todo{uploaded} with this
report: we \todo{checked} that its constraints and objective function
are linear (and we are aware that four points will otherwise be
deducted from our score for this problem).
%
We chose the MIP solver~\SolverMIP for our experiments, which we ran
\todo{on the NEOS server or
  % specification of the ThinLinc Linux hosts of the IT department,
  % where the academic site license for Gurobi is installed, but note
  % that no classroom license for AMPL is installed there, so replace
  % if need be by a similar-looking specification of your own hardware:
  under Linux Ubuntu~18.04 ($64$~bit) on an Intel Xeon E5520 of
  $2.27$~GHz, with $4$~processors of $4$~cores each, with a $70$~GB
  RAM and an $8$~MB L3 cache (a ThinLinc computer of the IT
  department)}.

\paragraph{Task~c: 10 Zones.}
The results are in Table~\ref{tab:res:mip}.
%
When~$s$ increases, the optimal objective value~\todo{\filler}.

\paragraph{Task~d: 20 Zones.}
The results are in Table~\ref{tab:res:mip}.
%
When~$s$ grows beyond~$4$, the optimal objective value \todo{\filler}.

\paragraph{Task~e: 40 Zones.}
The results are in Table~\ref{tab:res:mip}.

\paragraph{Task~f: 80 Zones.}
The results are in Table~\ref{tab:res:mip}.
%
Upon~$s=16$ service stations with~$v=1$ vehicle each, the optimal
objective value is \todo{\filler} the one for~$s=8$ and~$v=2$, because
\todo{\filler}.

\paragraph{Task~g: 120 Zones.}
The results are in Table~\ref{tab:res:mip}.
%
Our model \todo{does not time out}.
% If it does time out, then see the demo sentence under Task h below!

\paragraph{Task~h: 250 Zones.}
The results are in Table~\ref{tab:res:mip}.
%
Our model \todo{times out, so our proposed algorithm for delivering a
  not necessarily optimal solution in reasonable running time is
  \filler}.

\paragraph{Task~i: Brute-Force Algorithm.}
The size of the search space of a totally brute-force search algorithm
is \todo{$\binom{z!}{\cos c} \cdot \log_s v$}, because \todo{\filler}.

The numbers of candidate solutions this brute-force search algorithm
has to examine per second in order to match the reported runtime
performance of~\SolverMIP on our model are given in the right-most
column of Table~\ref{tab:res:mip}, for each instance that~\SolverMIP
solved to proven optimality without timing out.

We think that \todo{\filler}, because \todo{\filler}.
